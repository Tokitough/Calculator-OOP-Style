# Calculator in OOP 

## About the Program
Programmed in an object-oriented style, the programs works like a normal calculator. However, this calculator can only compute two numbers at a time.

## How to Run It
1. Run the program

2. The program asks the user what type of calculation would it like to perform.

3. The user is asked to input 2 numbers.

4. The answer is then displayed.

5. After finishing the calculation, the program will ask the user if he/she wants to perform another calculation. If the user does not want to do any more calculation, input "n" and the program should end.

6. If there are any invalid inputs, the program catches it and asks the user again for another input.
